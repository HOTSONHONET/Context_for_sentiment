Those who have died before their time, i have heard that they become stars. I am afraid, i won't be able to find you among thousands of them there.
I don't know for how long i have craved your presence and how many times my heart is broken in your absence.I don't believe in your god anymore, and one fine day, i'll break his heart too.
